            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
             <li>Prepare the Legumes: Drain and rinse the soaked chickpeas. In a large pot, combine the chickpeas, lentils, and rice. Cover with water (about 8 cups), bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 45 minutes or until the legumes are tender.</li>
                                <li>Sauté Aromatics: In a separate pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions, celery, tomatoes, cilantro, and parsley. Sauté until the onions are translucent.</li>
                                <li>Spice Infusion: Add ground ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, paprika, black pepper, and salt to the sautéed mixture. Cook for a few minutes until the spices release their aroma.</li>
                                <li>Combine and Simmer: Transfer the sautéed mixture to the pot with the cooked legumes. Stir well and let the soup simmer for another 20-30 minutes, allowing flavors to meld.</li>
                                <li>Adjust Consistency: If the soup is too thick, add more water to reach your desired consistency. Adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
                                <li>Serve: Ladle the hot Harira soup into bowls. Serve with a wedge of lemon on the side for squeezing over the soup before enjoying.</li>
                                <li>Optional: For added texture, cook a handful of vermicelli or broken-up angel hair pasta separately and add it to the soup before serving.</li>
