                                <li>1 cup chicken broth or water</li>

                                <li>Fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>

        <li>Prepare the Chicken: Season the chicken thighs with salt, pepper, ground ginger, ground cumin, paprika, and ground cinnamon. Rub the seasoning well into the chicken.</li>
        <li>Sauté Onion and Garlic: In a tajine or a deep skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until softened. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Brown the Chicken: Push the onion and garlic to the sides of the tajine and add the seasoned chicken thighs. Brown them on both sides for about 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Add Liquid and Simmer: Pour in the chicken broth or water. Arrange the slices of preserved lemon over the chicken. Bring it to a simmer, cover the tajine, and let it cook for 25-30 minutes or until the chicken is tender and fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Add Olives and Serve: Add the green olives to the tajine during the last 10 minutes of cooking to infuse their flavor into the dish. Check the seasoning and adjust if necessary.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Sprinkle chopped fresh cilantro or parsley over the tajine before serving. Serve the chicken tajine hot with couscous or crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce.</li>
